      My first encounter with robotics competition was 6 years ago. Fascinated by the robot I built, I prepared for the FLL robotic competition. After the exciting tournament, I have not evolved in any robotics project, because my junior high does not have a robotic club; Then, after graduated from junior high, I was delighted that there is a robotic club. I joined the club in excitement and started to prepare the playoff game of FRC(first robotics competition)——CRC(China Robotics Competition). FRC/CRC is different from FLL, the robots we built is from scratch. We need to use 3d modelling programmes such as solidworks to formulate a 3d model of our robot. Then, we need to send these 3d-model parts to factories for them to process. This is a uncharted territory for me. I started from learning how to use solidworks to draw 3d parts, and how to use java language to program our robot. I mastered these skills in less than a month, and we officially started the preparation for CRC. I am so passionate about robotics, and I want to learn all the knowledge associate with it. From discussion of tactics, to the discussion of mechanical parts, I participated in every possible section. After formulated our design, some senior students and I worked from 9 in the morning to mid-night. We draw our parts from computer and started formulating our code structure. It was hard, but I indeed learned a lot. As a new member of the club, I was able to take full responsibility of mechanical designing and drawing, also programming. I designed the climbing mechanism for our robot, and the part was highly praised by our mentor and senior students. After constructing the structure code in java, I started investigating on computer vision. Using python, I successfully implemented the function. Actually this is the first time in our club using computer vison to localize target. We successfully built our robot in time and went to Zhengzhou for the competition. I thought we are fully prepared, however, it turns out other wise. We encountered many unpredictable error during the competition. I was panicked at first, but I calm down and help to fix the problem. We did not get a really high ranking point in the end, however, this is still a great result for me. I have leaned a lot from this competition. 
   
      After the competition, I was even more passionate with robotics. I read lot of book about mechanical design and programming. Our mentor assign me as mentor for our 4 FTC team, and also let me in charge of training of new programmers. I published videos on the internet and leave homework for new programmers, which is really effective. The FTC team I mentored also reached top rank in the FTC regional. 
   
      Then, I participated in the 2018 FRC competition. We started preparation soon after the theme was published. Our programmer team works hard in the beginning; we aim to provide the best code and maximize the potential of mechanical structure. We also studies and implemented heuristic algorithm to find the best route for our robot to reach the destination. Combining A star and artificial potential field, the hybrid algorithm works great in our simulation. We devoted ourselves in to the support of mechanical group after the parts were assembled.

      We end up with rank 3 in Shenzhen regional and get 
   
      - Innovation in Control Award sponsored by Rockwell Automation
   
      - wild card
   
      We have got the opportunity to attend world championship and compete with elite robots from all over the world!

2. Pyclub 

```
      1. Activity type: Computer & peer tutor
    
      2. Position: Co-founder of the club
    
      3. Description: 
    
         As I mastered Python language, I found out that there are a lot of 10th grade students that wanted to learn about programming. I was eager to help them, because I could see the shadow of myself from them. Therefore, some classmates and I founded this club; our primary goal is to let members of our club realize the interest of programming. We elaborated our syllabus and designed interesting projects for our members. [...]

3. Mathematical modeling competition

```
      1. Activity type: Academic
    
      2. Position: Group leader
    
      3. Description:
    
         Just after graduation from junior high, I heard the term mathematical modeling from a senior. He recommended this activity to me, for its innovative and academic feature. I was not so interested by that time. However, after I mastered Python and learned some basic linear algebra and calculus, I found mathematical modeling charming. It is the integration of mathematics thinking and logic with algorithm. I quickly formed a team for the HIMCM tournament. I admit, we do not have a through understanding of the knowledge required, but we try our best and formulate two algorithms for the question. They are not very effective in solving the problem, and we ended up with an honorable mention for this contest. Nevertheless, this was a great experience for me. I understood there are a lot of things to learn. This failure gave me the motivation for the study in mathematics. The next opportunity is the CUMCM, the competition for Chinese undergraduates. I got an opportunity to form a team and take part in this contest. After considering possible variables, I employed k-means and DEA; with the help of machine learning, we came up with a pretty well-rounded solution for the question. We got second prize in this contest, which is a indicator for my effort during the past 9 months. To put an end on this activity, I participates in the IMMC contest, ending up with two first prize for both international and Asian regional. They were not outstanding results, however, it is the representation of my innovative thinking and mathematical ability.
